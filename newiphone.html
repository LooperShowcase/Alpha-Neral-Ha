  <p>The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth-generation flagship iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The devices were unveiled alongside the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus during the Apple Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022.Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max began on September 9, 2022, and were made available on September 16, 2022.

    The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are the first iPhones to have a new type of display cutout called "Dynamic Island", replacing the notch design that has been in use since the iPhone X was introduced. Along with the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro models add bidirectional satellite connectivity to contact emergency services when out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular networks. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models (as well as the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus) sold in the United States dropped support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to lack a discrete SIM card reader.</p>
